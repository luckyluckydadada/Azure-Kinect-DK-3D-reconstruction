    "## TSDF voxels\n",
    "TSDF (truncated signed distance function) is a useful map representation to fuse and denoise a sequence of Depth/RGB-D images with known camera poses. It voxelizes the 3D space; for each voxel, it computes weight average of signed distance to its closest surface observations from multiple scans. Note this signed distance is **truncated** to preserve details, so that voxels too far away from the surface won't be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this description, each voxel stores a `float` tsdf value and a `float` or `uint16` weight. At current, we also optionally support `rgb` colors of `float` or `uint16` (we do not use `uint8` to preserve precision during integration). Supported combinations are:\n",
    "- `float` tsdf, `float` weight\n",
    "- `float` tsdf, `float` weight, `float` rgb\n",
    "- `float` tsdf, `uint16` weight, `uint16` rgb\n",
    "\n",
    "Users may also customize their own voxel types and include other properties (e.g., semantic mask), after modifying the voxels and dispatch pattern in `core/kernel/GeneralEWSharedImpl.h`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Voxel blocks and spatial hashing\n",
    "Initially, in KinectFusion, TSDF is defined in a restricted $512^3$ cube. While this is useful to represent small scenes, it has to sacrifice reconstruction resolution for larger scale environments. VoxelHashing introduces an improved representation where the 3D space is roughly divided into $16^3$ **voxel blocks**. These voxel blocks will only be allocated around surfaces, i.e., around depth observations, and can be indexed dynamically by 3D coordinate using a **hashmap**.\n",
